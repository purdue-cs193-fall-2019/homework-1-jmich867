# Justin Michael's First CS193 Homework
   
   Five things I like about CS193:
   - It's a low stress course
   - I'm already learning new things
   - It's run by students who were in my shoes pretty recently
   - It's a break from hard courses, without feeling like a waste of time
   - Class size is a nice middle ground between a huge 300+ person lecture, and a small 20 person "traditional" classroom
